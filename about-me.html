						<p>I am a Certified ScrumMaster® (CSM), a Certified Scrum Product Owner® (CSPO), an SAP Certified NetWeaver Consultant, and former SAP Mentor in the area of Portal and Knowledge Management and Collaboration. I've been working as a technical consultant and project manager since 2002, implementing over 30 different portal and knowledge management applications worldwide. I specialize in agile management methods like Scrum and help customers improve their business by introducing agile development principles.</p>
						<p>Among other projects, I was responsible for the design and implementation of the knowledge management platform in the SAP intranet portal (Employee Network) and I also supported the rollout of the HR Portal into ten countries at BP International PLC. For the past three years, I've been responsible for the design and implementation of SAP's biggest website (http://help.sap.com) with over 10 million pages and 500,000 hits per day, as well as the SAP internal address book replacement. Besides my responsibilities as a Product Owner, I've also acted as a consultant and trainer for other Product Owners and ScrumMasters at SAP.</p>
						<p>I'm ranked among the all-time top contributors to the SAP Community Network (SCN) discussion forums "Portal" and "Knowledge Management" and was honoured for four consecutive years as a top contributor by the SAP board committee. From 2007 to 2011, I was an SAP Mentor and I am now an SAP Mentor alumni. The SAP Mentor programme is a highly selective programme recognizing those individuals that make an outstanding contribution to the SAP ecosystem (<a href="http://sapmentors.sap.com">sapmentors.sap.com</a>).</p>

									<h2>Agile Team Coaching</h2>
									<p>Maybe you need to kick off a new project and are interested in using agile methods. Maybe you don't know which agile method to use. Maybe you need some guidance on creating product backlogs, working with remote teams, or need a hands-on ScrumMaster, Product Owner or project mentor for your organization.</p>
									<p>Whatever your needs, I can work with you to understand them and help you build a customized plan to help you use agile methods successfully.</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h2>Management Coaching</h2>
									<p>Agile practices are new and intimidating for most people. Managers in particular struggle with agile concepts, mostly due to its focus on the self-managed team and adaptive (vs. predictive) planning.</p>
									<p>I help managers and executives to learn how to support an agile framework and utilize an agile mind-set to discover new ways of adding value to the organization and the business.</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									 <h2>Process Analysis and Process Design</h2>
									<p>Implementing new systems and applications always requires a deep understanding of the underlying business processes.</p>
									<p>My strength is to help you analyse and optimize existing business processes and to introduce agile methodologies for an improved development process.</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h2>Design and Implementation of Knowledge Management Systems</h2>
									<p>Successful implementation of knowledge management solutions requires an understanding of knowledge management as a business process rather than a technological solution.</p>
									<p>I'll help you introduce an implementation strategy that integrates information technology, organizational culture, organizational processes and senior management support to make it one cohesive system.</p>
